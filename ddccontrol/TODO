BUGS:
 - Fix Samsung 720T (not detected as LCD as type is "LCD CM")
 - Fix Samsung 740BF (not detected as LCD)
 - Fix Mitsubishi DiamondPro 930SB (not detected as CRT (type(CRT_AG)))

 - When changing a control value quickly (moving the mouse outside the control),
   the value on the scale does not correspond to the real value.
 - "My only criticism is that the slider
   controls in the GUI seem a bit "jittery."  They jump a little when you
   slide them.  This is most noticable if you are trying to move it only a
   short distance.  I am not sure what the cause of this is, but I though I
   should let you know."
