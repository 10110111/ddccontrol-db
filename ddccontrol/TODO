Nicolas:
 - Read EDID info
 - Use this instead of Xinerama ?

 - Add support for more than 2 monitors
 - See what to do with engineering VCP.

BUGS:
 - When changing a control value quickly (moving the mouse outside the control),
   the value on the scale does not correspond to the real value.
 - "My only criticism is that the slider
   controls in the GUI seem a bit "jittery."  They jump a little when you
   slide them.  This is most noticable if you are trying to move it only a
   short distance.  I am not sure what the cause of this is, but I though I
   should let you know."
